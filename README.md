This program was made using C++ and the file that contains `main()` is `Assignments/src/CG_hw1.cpp`. \
\
The only third party libraries that I am using is [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for Unit Testing. Other than that library everything is written by me. \
\
To compile the program simply run `make` and that will run the cmake commands to build the project as well as copy the executable to the root directory. \
\
Line clipping is located in `slm/src/Scene.h` on `Line 35`.
