This program was made using C++ and the file that contains `main()` is `Assignments/CG_hw2/src/CG_hw2.cpp`. \
\
The only third party libraries that I am using is [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for Unit Testing. Other than that library everything is written by me. \
I am also using glm for HW4 to do some of the clipping math with matricies. This is located in `slm/src/Primitive.cpp` \
I am pretty close to the expected output, but I just couldn't figure out what was wrong with the perspective scaling. \
This was also a complete redesign on the previous assignments and all the code for this was done between Assignment 3 & Assignment 4. \
My goal was to fully unit test everything and I was able to do that with almost everything. \
\
To compile the program simply run `make` and that will run the cmake commands to build the project as well as copy the executable to the root directory. \

This project is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/lawrencemsteven/SoftwareRenderer).
